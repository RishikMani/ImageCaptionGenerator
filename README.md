# ImageCaptionGenerator

In this project I will develop an image caption generator model. The model will be trained on Flickr dataset. Flickr dataset contains 8000 images. The dataset has been divided into 6000 train images, 1000 dev images and 1000 train images. The dataset consists of a directory consisting of images and another directory consisting of text files consisting of descriptions about various images. The text files also contain three files consisting of image identifiers for the three different datasets. You can download the datasets from the following links:
1. [Flickr8k_dataset.zip](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_Dataset.zip)
2. [Flickr8k_text.zip](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_text.zip)

For further understanding of the project refer to the [notebook](https://github.com/RishikMani/ImageCaptionGenerator/blob/main/GeneratePhotoCaption.ipynb).

Note: For this repository I have referenced Jason Bronwlee's blog for [image caption generator](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/).
